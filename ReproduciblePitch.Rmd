# Overview

This peer assessed assignment has two parts:

-   First, you will create a Shiny application and deploy it on Rstudio's servers.

-   Second, you will use Slidify or Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How to use the application

This application is using data related to geysers comparing the frequency and the waiting time (in mins) in between eruptions.

The slider needs to be used to select the number of bins that you would like to see in the plot along whit the data. 

- Application link: http://mariamezquita.shinyapps.io/Module5

- The ui.R and Server.R code created will be placed into my GitHub Repository: https://github.com/maria-mezquita/ShinyApp-and-Reproducible-Pitch.git


------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How many bins would you like to display?

Use the slider on the next slide to select the amount of bins that you would like the plot coming in the upcoming slides to showcase the data. 


Please note, minimum is 1, maximum number of bins available for selection is 50.
